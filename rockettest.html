<!-- Variable is something that refers to something else -->
<!-- Can store arrays in variables, all within square brackets separated by commas -->
<!-- Boolean can be stored in variables as well - true/false 0/1 -->
<!-- Can store OBJECTS in variables but can combine all of these things, separated by a {} -->

<!-- Functions can perform tasks - the METHOD is inside the {} brackets, and functions can be stored inside variables -->

<!-- Difference between RETURN and CONSOLE.LOG is that one actually stores and returns the output, whilst the other displays the output and nothing more -->

<!-- We can input parameters into functions within the regular () brackets to use later in the return function (similar to Python) -->

<!-- If statements are begin with if(true/false) followed by {} for the true clause. Then the ELSE clause comes right after the first {} brackets with its own set of {}. Can also use ELSE IF functions. Syntax for AND is && and syntax for OR is || -->

<!-- 'This' always refers to the original variable -->

<!-- Double = sign forces a boolean comparison -->
