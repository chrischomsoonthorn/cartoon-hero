		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>I am a 24 year old Marketing & Sales Graduate working in the automotive industry, looking to develop my programming and software/web development skills. </p>
		<p>As I improve, this blog will continue to develop and I will share my progress photos of key attainments to date.</p>
		<!-- href="https://ibb.co/L5MBYrQ" one of the biggest issues I had was GitHub not recognising the image below - this is because it is CASE SENSITIVE and the .png extension was in lowercase, NOT upper case so it wasn't being picked up!-->
		<p> As of 4<sup>th</sup> August 2020, <a href="./img/portfolio04082020.PNG" target="_blank">this</a> is what my blog looks like.</p>
