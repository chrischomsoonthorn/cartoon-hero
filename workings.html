		<h2 class="exampletitle"> Example 1 - Using Classes</h2> 
		<h2 class="exampledesc">String text delivered through 'span' element with adjusted formatting from class labelling.</h2>
		<div class="examplebox">
			<span class="test1">This is an example of test text with class name 'test1' under the <u>Span</u> element. as you can see, as soon as I</span> 
			<span class="test2"> change the span's class to the new class, which is now 'test2', the font and colours change</span>
			<span class="test3">. This can look seemless as if this text was all part of one string but actually it is several spans concatenated together and assigned different classes.</span>

					<p>Here is some example text and we can examine how this text will wrap around the images as these images are assigned through CSS to 'FLOAT' Further text here is simply to demonstrate the text wrapping around the images to the left and the right. Try resizing your browser to see if it works!</p>
					<p>This also works when starting a new paragraph, as you can see the text moves around the images and fits snugly.</p>

					<p> Updated 06/08 Here is some example text and we can examine how this text will wrap around the images as these images are assigned through CSS to 'FLOAT' Further text here is simply to demonstrate the text wrapping around the images to the left and the right. More importantly in this example I am using the 'clear' function to show that we can put a series of images on the left hand side! Try resizing your browser to see if it works!</p>
					<p>This also works when starting a new paragraph, as you can see the text moves around the images and fits snugly.</p>
					<p>Please find linked the sources of the <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/ed/25/33ed25e730c3170629cedf5166cfa011.gif" target="_blank">bulbasaur nyan cat</a> and <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/ed/25/33ed25e730c3170629cedf5166cfa011.gif" target="_blank">cute icecream cone</a> linked.</p>
					<p>These images are the exact same width because I have set the width of the images to 30px which means they will be 30% of the width of the current body size, so from a width perspective they will always match.</p>
					<p>This is also only possible having the images in the code BEFORE the text, so that they 'float' on top. <a href=./img/floatexampleadvanced1.PNG target="_blank">Here's an example of the code (as an image, after the text.)</a></p>
					<p>If I put an image below the code this is what happens:</p>

		<h2 class="exampletitle"> Example 4 - Using a clear fix to create a set of div boxes to contain any content</h2> 
		<h2 class="exampledesc">Using a clear fix, i.e. setting a class with a pseudoclass of 'after', followed by entering no content and displaying it as a table followed by 'clear: both;' allows for content to be shown in similarly shaped blocks which can serve as menu items or tabs. </h2>
		<div class="examplebox">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">This is column 1</div>
				<div class="col">This is column 2</div>
				<div class="col">This is column 3</div>
				<div class="col"><a href="https://www.google.co.uk">This is column 4 (with link)</a></div>
				<div class="col">This is column 5 - this contains much more data than the others so we will see how it reacts. It looks like it fills in the space. I can adjust this by changing the width or height but I like this. </div>
