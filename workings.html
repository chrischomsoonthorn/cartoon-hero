		<h2 class="exampledesc">String text delivered through 'span' element with adjusted formatting from class labelling.</h2>
		<div class="examplebox">
			<span class="test1">This is an example of test text with class name 'test1' under the <u>Span</u> element. as you can see, as soon as I</span> 
			<span class="test2"> change the span's class to the new class, which is now 'test2', the font and colours change</span>
			<span class="test3">. This can look seemless as if this text was all part of one string but actually it is several spans concatenated together and assigned different classes.</span>

				<p>Here is some example text and we can examine how this text will wrap around the images as these images are assigned through CSS to 'FLOAT' Further text here is simply to demonstrate the text wrapping around the images to the left and the right.</p>
				<p>This also works when starting a new paragraph, as you can see the text moves around the images and fits snugly.</p>
