				<span class="test2"> change the span's class to the new class, which is now 'test2', the font and colours change</span>
				<span class="test3">. This can look seemless as if this text was all part of one string but actually it is several spans concatenated together and assigned different classes.</span>

						<p> Updated 06/08 Here is some example text and we can examine how this text will wrap around the images as these images are assigned through CSS to 'FLOAT' Further text here is simply to demonstrate the text wrapping around the images to the left and the right. More importantly in this example I am using the 'clear' function to show that we can put a series of images on the left hand side! Try resizing your browser to see if it works!</p>
						<p>This also works when starting a new paragraph, as you can see the text moves around the images and fits snugly.</p>

						<p>These images are the exact same width because I have set the width of the images to 30px which means they will be 30% of the width of the current body size, so from a width perspective they will always match.</p>
						<p>This is also only possible having the images in the code BEFORE the text, so that they 'float' on top. <a href=./img/floatexampleadvanced1.PNG target="_blank">Here's an example of the code (as an image, after the text.)</a></p>
						<p>If I put an image below the code this is what happens:</p>

		<!-- Example 4 - Clear Fix -->

		<div class="borderbox1">
			<h2 class="exampletitle">Learning 4 - Using a clear fix to create a set of div boxes to contain any content</h2> 
			<h2 class="exampledesc">Using a clear fix, i.e. setting a class with a pseudoclass of 'after', followed by entering no content and displaying it as a table followed by 'clear: both;' allows for content to be shown in similarly shaped blocks which can serve as menu items or tabs. </h2>
			<div class="examplebox">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">This is column 1</div>
					<div class="col">This is column 2</div>
					<div class="col">This is column 3</div>
					<div class="col"><a href="https://www.google.co.uk">This is column 4 (with link)</a></div>
					<div class="col">This is column 5 - this contains much more data than the others so we will see how it reacts. It looks like it fills in the space. I can adjust this by changing the width or height but I like this. </div>

		<!-- Example 5 Transform and Translate-->

		<div class="borderbox1">
			<h2 class="exampletitle">Learning 5 - Using the 'transform' attribute</h2> 
			<h2 class="exampledesc">Transform X & Y is a little different from the other attributes because it follows a different syntax: transform: translateX(50px). There are 2 elements to the syntax which need to be written. So with the example below, I will transform column 2 and column 3 by X and Y values respectively. </h2>
			<div class="examplebox">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">This is column 1</div>
					<div class="col2">This is column 2 transformed in the X axis by 50px</div>
					<div class="col3">This is column 3 transformed in the Y axis by 50px</div>

		<!-- Example 6 Static Relative and Absolute Positioning-->

		<div class="borderbox1">
			<h2 class="exampletitle">Learning 6 - Static, Relative and Absolute Positioning</h2> 
			<h2 class="exampledesc">This is probably going to be a big post... Positioning in CSS and HTML was a little bit tricky to get my head around. The attribute of positioning i.e. positioning: relative; for instance differs a lot depending on which one you select. </h2>
			<!-- Static Positioning -->
			<h2 class="exampledesc"> Below is an example of STATIC positioning: </h2>
			<div class="examplebox">
				<div class="static1"> This is the parent relative box
					<div class="static2">This is static child 1</div>
					<div class="static2">This is static child 2</div>
					<div class="static2">This is static child 3</div>
				</div>
			<h2 class="examplecaption"> Above we can see that, along with the necessary margining and padding added to the elements, all of the static elements take up 100% of the width of the object and resize themselves appropriately to fit the screen size which is shown, which is pretty awesome as we don't need to go and manually adjust the height and width and so on. It is 'always positioned with normal accordance to the page.' </h2>
			</div>
			<!-- Relative positioning -->
			<h2 class="exampledesc">Below is an example of RELATIVE positioning: </h2>
				<div class="examplebox">
					<div class="static1"> This is the parent relative box
						<div class="relative1">This is relative child 1 - moved from the left by 10px</div>
						<div class="relative2">This is relative child 2 - moved from the left by 20px - you can see how using relative positioning allows us to change left/right/top/bottom values</div>
						<div class="relative3">This is relative child 3 - it's left value exceeds that of the boundaries of the parent static box</div>
					</div>
					<h2 class="examplecaption"> Relative positioning allows the user to adjust the element's top/bottom/right/left values. Importantly this does not affect how other elements 'perceive' the relative element to move. This is why it goes out of the parent box. The parent box still 'thinks' the element is in it's normal place. </h2>
				</div>
				<!-- Absolute positioning -->
			<h2 class="exampledesc"> Below is an example of ABSOLUTE positioning: </h2>
				<div class="examplebox">
					<div class="static1"> This is the parent relative box
						<div class="absolute1">This is absolute child 1</div>
						<div class="absolute2">This is absolute child 2</div>
						<div class="absolute3">This is absolute child 3</div>
						<div class="absolute4">This is absolute child 4</div>
					</div>
					<h2 class="examplecaption"> Similar to floating an element, absolute positioning allows the user to specifically customise exactly where an element will go. The box that the absolute element is also sized appropriately to the content inside. Absolute elements will 'cling' to the nearest relative element for reference. In this case it clings to the parent relative box. If we wanted to remove the relative attribute from the parent box we would end up with the child absolute boxes at the top and bottom of the page respectively. An example of this is in the bottom right at the top of the page where it says 'Hope you enjoy reading!' </h2>

		<!-- Example 7 Depth and Z-Index -->

		<div class="borderbox1">
			<h2 class="exampletitle">Learning 7 - Depth and Z-Index</h2> 
			<h2 class="exampledesc">Every non-static element in HTML has a depth element or 'z-index' automatically attributed to it. All relative elements gain more depth the lower down the HTML tree or code. Inside of a relative parent, absolute elements follow the same logic; the further down they are, the higher depth value they have. This can be manually overrided using the Z-Index CSS attribute. Example below</h2>
				<div class="examplebox">
					<div class="relative4"> This is a parent relative box
						<div class="absolute5">This is an absolute child at the top of HTML code</div>
						<div class="absolute6">This is an absolute child 2nd from top of HTML code</div>
						<div class="absolute7">This is an absolute child 3rd from top of HTML code</div>
						<div class="absolute8">This is an absolute child at the bottom of HTML code</div>
					</div>
				</div>

			<h2 class="exampledesc">In the above example, you can see the 4 absolute child boxes are equally spaced, and therefore there is no overlapping. However, if we were to overlap it, we would see that the child at the bottom has the highest depth value and therefore falls on top.</h2>
				
				<div class="examplebox">
					<div class="relative4"> This is a parent relative box
						<div class="absolute9">This is an absolute child at the top of HTML code</div>
						<div class="absolute10">This is an absolute child 2nd from top of HTML code</div>
						<div class="absolute11">This is an absolute child 3rd from top of HTML code</div>
						<div class="absolute12">This is an absolute child at the bottom of HTML code</div>
					</div>
				</div>

			<h2 class="exampledesc">This can simply be adjusted by adjusting the z-index value of the child classes to a z-index of 1 or above to denote their ranking - the higher the ranking, the higher the depth. Picture of the code is below: </h2>
			<img src="./img/zindexexample1.PNG" class="standardimage">
			
			<h2 class="exampledesc">Now we can see that the HTML code 2nd from the top has the CSS Z-Index value of 4 thereby giving it the highest value out of its peer elements in the parent relative box. Therefore, we should see the 2nd from the top emerge as the highest depth element and therefore on top - and we can see that below: </h2>

				<div class="examplebox">
					<div class="relative4"> This is a parent relative box
						<div class="absolute13">This is an absolute child at the top of HTML code</div>
						<div class="absolute14">This is an absolute child 2nd from top of HTML code</div>
						<div class="absolute15">This is an absolute child 3rd from top of HTML code</div>
						<div class="absolute16">This is an absolute child at the bottom of HTML code</div>
